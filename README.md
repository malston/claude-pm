# claude-pm

A comprehensive CLI tool for managing Claude Code plugins, marketplaces, and MCP servers.

## Overview

`claude-pm` provides visibility into and control over your Claude Code installation, including:

- Installed plugins and their state (enable/disable individual plugins)
- Marketplace repositories
- MCP server configuration (granular control over individual MCP servers)
- Plugin updates and maintenance

This is a community-built tool that provides a unified interface for managing Claude Code plugins and MCP servers.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/malston/claude-pm/cmd/claude-pm@latest
```

```

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Show overview of your Claude installation
claude-pm status

# List all installed plugins
claude-pm plugins

# Enable/disable plugins
claude-pm disable compound-engineering@every-marketplace
claude-pm enable compound-engineering@every-marketplace

# List installed marketplaces
claude-pm marketplaces

# List MCP servers by plugin
claude-pm mcp list

# Enable/disable specific MCP servers
claude-pm mcp disable superpowers-chrome@superpowers-marketplace:chrome
claude-pm mcp enable superpowers-chrome@superpowers-marketplace:chrome
```

### Commands

#### Status

Show an overview of your Claude Code installation:

```bash
claude-pm status
```

Example output:

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
║           claude-pm Status             ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

Marketplaces (7)
  ✓ superpowers-marketplace
  ✓ claude-code-plugins
  ✓ every-marketplace
  ...

Plugins (27 total)
  ✓ 8 enabled

MCP Servers
  → Run 'claude-pm mcp list' for details

Issues Detected
  ⚠ 19 plugins have stale paths
  → Run 'claude-pm doctor' for details
```

#### Plugins

List all installed plugins with detailed information:

```bash
claude-pm plugins

# Show only summary statistics
claude-pm plugins --summary
```

Shows version, status, installation path, and type (local/cached) for each plugin.

**Plugin Types:**

- **Cached:** Plugin copied to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`
- **Local:** Plugin referenced from marketplace directory

#### Marketplaces

List all installed marketplace repositories:

```bash
claude-pm marketplaces
```

Shows source, repository, location, and last update time for each marketplace.

#### MCP Servers

List MCP servers grouped by the plugin that provides them:

```bash
claude-pm mcp list
```

Shows command, arguments, and environment variables for each MCP server.

#### Enable/Disable Plugins

Enable or disable individual plugins:

```bash
# Disable a plugin
claude-pm disable hookify@claude-code-plugins

# Re-enable a plugin
claude-pm enable hookify@claude-code-plugins
```

When you disable a plugin:

- It's removed from `installed_plugins.json`
- Its metadata is saved to `~/.claude-pm/config.json`
- All commands, agents, skills, and MCP servers become unavailable

When you re-enable it:

- The metadata is restored from config
- The plugin becomes available again immediately
- No need to reinstall

#### Enable/Disable MCP Servers

Control individual MCP servers without disabling the entire plugin:

```bash
# Disable a specific MCP server
claude-pm mcp disable compound-engineering@every-marketplace:playwright

# Re-enable it
claude-pm mcp enable compound-engineering@every-marketplace:playwright
```

This is useful for:

- Reducing MCP context usage
- Disabling heavy servers (like Playwright) when not needed
- Keeping plugin features (commands, skills) while removing MCP tools

**Note:** MCP server changes require restarting Claude Code to take effect.

#### Maintenance & Diagnostics

Diagnose and fix common issues with your Claude installation:

```bash
# Check for updates
claude-pm update --check-only   # See what's available
claude-pm update                # Apply updates

# Run comprehensive diagnostics
claude-pm doctor

# Fix and clean up plugin issues (default: fix + remove)
claude-pm cleanup               # Fix paths and remove broken entries
claude-pm cleanup --dry-run     # Preview changes
claude-pm cleanup --fix-only    # Only fix paths, don't remove
claude-pm cleanup --remove-only # Only remove broken entries
```

**Doctor Command:**

- Checks all marketplaces exist
- Identifies fixable path issues (missing subdirectories)
- Identifies truly missing plugins
- Recommends using `cleanup` to resolve issues

**Cleanup Command:**

By default, fixes and removes plugin issues in one operation:

- **Fixes** plugins with correctable path issues (missing subdirectories)
- **Removes** plugin entries that are truly broken (no valid path exists)
- `--fix-only` flag to only fix paths without removing entries
- `--remove-only` flag to only remove broken entries without fixing
- `--dry-run` flag to preview changes without applying them
- `--reinstall` flag to show reinstall commands for removed plugins

**Update Command:**

- Checks marketplaces for git updates
- Checks plugins for newer marketplace commits
- `--check-only` flag to preview without applying
- Updates marketplaces via git pull
- Updates plugin commit references

## Understanding Plugin Types

Claude Code installs plugins in two different ways, which affects how they're stored and whether they're prone to path issues.

### Plugin Storage Types

**Cached Plugins (`isLocal: false`)**

- Plugin is **copied** to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/plugin-name`
- Creates an independent copy separate from the marketplace
- More stable - less prone to path issues
- Example: Most superpowers-marketplace plugins

**Local Plugins (`isLocal: true`)**

- Plugin **references** the marketplace directory directly
- Path: `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/marketplace-name/plugins/plugin-name`
- No separate copy - points directly to marketplace
- Example: Most claude-code-plugins plugins

### The Plugin Path Bug

There's a **known bug in the Claude CLI** that affects local plugins (see [Issue #11278](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/11278) and [Issue #12457](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/12457)):

**The Problem:**

1. Claude CLI sets `isLocal: true` for marketplace plugins
2. BUT creates paths **without** the `/plugins/` subdirectory
3. Results in broken paths like:
   - Wrong: `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-code-plugins/hookify`
   - Right: `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-code-plugins/plugins/hookify`

**The Impact:**

- Plugins appear in `installed_plugins.json` but paths don't exist
- Shows as "stale" in `claude-pm status`
- Plugin commands, skills, and MCP servers are unavailable

**The Fix:**

```bash
# Diagnose the issue
claude-pm doctor

# See which plugins are affected
claude-pm plugins --summary

# Fix the paths (and optionally remove any truly broken entries)
claude-pm cleanup
```

### Why the --summary Flag Exists

The `--summary` flag was added to help you:

1. **Identify affected plugins** - Local plugins are the ones with path bugs
2. **Understand your installation** - See how Claude CLI installed your plugins
3. **Track the fix** - Verify that `cleanup` corrected the issues
4. **Future troubleshooting** - Quickly check plugin type distribution

**Example:**

```bash
$ claude-pm plugins --summary

By Type:
  Cached: 7 (copied to ~/.claude/plugins/cache/)
  Local:  20 (referenced from marketplace)
```

If you have many "local" plugins, they were likely affected by the path bug. Run `claude-pm doctor` to check.

## Configuration

### Global Config File

`claude-pm` stores its configuration in `~/.claude-pm/config.json`:

```json
{
  "disabledPlugins": {
    "hookify@claude-code-plugins": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "installPath": "/Users/you/.claude/plugins/...",
      ...
    }
  },
  "disabledMcpServers": [
    "compound-engineering@every-marketplace:playwright"
  ],
  "claudeDir": "/Users/you/.claude",
  "preferences": {
    "autoUpdate": false,
    "verboseOutput": false
  }
}
```

The config file is created automatically on first use.

### Global Flags

- `--claude-dir` - Override the Claude installation directory (default: `~/.claude`)

Example:

```bash
claude-pm --claude-dir /custom/path status
```
